morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.</h1>
One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
himself <em>transformed</em> in his bed into a horrible <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vermin"
title="Wikipedia Vermin">vermin</a>. He lay on his armour-like back, and
if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly
domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly
able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide off
any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the
rest of him, link waved abouthelplessly as he looked. <cite>“What’s
happened to me?”</cite> he thought. It wasn’t a dream. His room, a
proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between
its four familiar walls.

<h2 id="the-bedding-was-hardly-able-to-cover-it.">The bedding was hardly
able to cover it.</h2>
<p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat
upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower
arm towards the viewer a solid fur muff into which her entire forearm
disappeared..</p>

<p>First he wanted to stand up quietly and undisturbed, get dressed,
above all have breakfast, and only then consider further action, for (he
noticed this clearly) by thinking things over in bed he would not reach
a reasonable conclusion. He remembered that he had already often felt a
light pain or other in bed, perhaps the result of an awkward lying
position, which later turned out to be purely imaginary when he stood
up, and he was eager to see how his present fantasies would gradually
dissipate. That the change in his voice was nothing other than the onset
of a real chill, an occupational illness of commercial travelers, of
that he had not the slightest doubt.</p>

<p>It was very easy to throw aside the blanket. He needed only to push
himself up a little, and it fell by itself. But to continue was
difficult, particularly because he was so unusually wide. He needed arms
and hands to push himself upright. Instead of these, however, he had
only many small limbs which were incessantly moving with very different
motions and which, in addition, he was unable to control. If he wanted
to bend one of them, then it was the first to extend itself, and if he
finally succeeded doing with this limb what he wanted, in the meantime
all the others, as if left free, moved around in an excessively painful
agitation. “But I must not stay in bed uselessly,” said Gregor to
himself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At first he wanted to get off the bed with the lower part of his
body, but this lower part (which he incidentally had not yet looked at
and which he also couldn’t picture clearly) proved itself too difficult
to move. The attempt went so slowly. When, having become almost frantic,
he finally hurled himself forward with all his force and without
thinking, he chose his direction incorrectly, and he hit the lower
bedpost hard. The violent pain he felt revealed to him that the lower
part of his body was at the moment probably the most sensitive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, he tried to get his upper body out of the bed first and turned
his head carefully toward the edge of the bed. He managed to do this
easily, and in spite of its width and weight his body mass at last
slowly followed the turning of his head. But as he finally raised his
head outside the bed in the open air, he became anxious about moving
forward any further in this manner, for if he allowed himself eventually
to fall by this process, it would take a miracle to prevent his head
from getting injured. And at all costs he must not lose consciousness
right now. He preferred to remain in bed.</p>
